#Task 1
# Python, I wish I could understand it clearer
# Maybe in the future, i will hold variables nearer
# Programing Languages are the future
# That's why Python is super 




# Task 2
'''
Python, in the realm of code you shine,
With simplicity and grace, you're truly divine.
 With libraries vast as stars in night skies,
 In Python's domain, innovation flies.
From data's deep seas to AI's high peaks,
 It speaks in patterns, in bytes, it speaks.
 Through loops and functions, its tales unfold,
 In scripts so daring, in logic so bold.
